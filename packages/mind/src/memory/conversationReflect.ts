// Conversation reflection — the "learn from talking, not just from commits" loop.
//
// reflectAfterTurn already distills CODING runs (commits → war-map). But most of
// what matters about the owner surfaces in plain conversation: preferences,
// personal facts, standing decisions, relationships. This module distills those
// durable facts from a chat transcript and writes them to Living Memory ONCE,
// deduped — so Ares remembers "Crix welds 12-hour shifts" without ever re-reading
// the transcript. Token-smart by construction: the digest is distilled to a few
// short facts, recalled compactly later, never the raw history.
//
// The distillation itself is an LLM call (the daemon supplies it via sideQueryJson);
// everything here is pure + testable: build the digest, dedup, write.
