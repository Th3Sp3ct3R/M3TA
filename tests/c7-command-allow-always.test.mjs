// C7 — "allow always" for shell commands now persists (v0.11.0, daily-friction).
//
// Before: picking "allow always" on a Bash/PowerShell command behaved exactly
// like "allow once" — the command permission store was read-only (no grant()),
// so the next session re-asked for `pnpm test` every time. Path grants persisted
// fine; commands silently didn't.
//
// The fix: a `grant()` on the command store + a `commandFor` hook on command
// tools, persisted by the permission gate (adaptToolForEngine) on allow_always.
// This drives the REAL BashTool through the gate with a grant() spy. The store's
// decide() forces the prompt; the command is a harmless `echo` so the real call
// is side-effect free.
